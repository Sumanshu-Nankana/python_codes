1 - Create a account on https://www.pythonanywhere.com
2 - sumanshu / Waheguruji@2020
3 - Go to Files Tab
4 - Upload Or Give any name to file to create new
5 - Save and Run (to make sure it's working fine)


=========================================
Like I created 'test.py'

from datetime import datetime

with open(datetime.now().strftime("%d-%m-%Y"),'w') as file:
    file.write("We automated this using pythonanywhere")
    
    
which is creating a new file with Date Name and writing some content into that
============================================

Now to schedule it

1 - Open the file
2 - Copy the directory path  (example - /home/sumanshu/test.py)
3 - Go to Tasks
4 - Give the directory path copied in step-2
5 - Specify the time - on which time - we want to run this script
6 - Click on Create
